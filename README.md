# Phishing Website Detection System

A machine learning-based system that detects phishing websites using **Logistic Regression** and **Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes**. The model analyzes various website features and classifies them as **legitimate or phishing** with high accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Built using **Flask** and **Scikit-learn**.
- Detects phishing websites with **95% accuracy**.
- Processes website features for classification.
- Simple web interface for real-time predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **HTML, CSS (for UI)**
